# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstrter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
  - Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared on their launch dates and their funding goals. She wants to know how the theater based campaigns fared on their launch dates.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  - Theater based launches had the highest and successful launch dates in the Month of April and June year in year out.
  - She saw a 61% success vs a 36% failure rate on meeting her launch dates throughout the year.
### Analysis of Outcome Based on Goals

  - She saw a lot of success when the $ goals were less, and continued to decline was the goal for more dollars increased.
  - She also saw fewer cancellations when the dollar goal was low. 
  - She witnessed more failure as the goal to increase the dollar goal progressed.
  - At about $20,000 to $24,999, failurate climaxed, even though the success rate declined.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  - **On the outcomes based on launch,** it was difficult to group the Year and Parent category together. However, with some data manipulation, I was able to work it out to show required results## Results
  - **On the outcomes based on goals**, the countifs formula required diligence and accuracy . Had some minor challenges tracking the syntax, and logic ensured accuracy. Once that was figured out, the rest was straightforward- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- **What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Launch?**
    - Spring time through summer time (April/May) is a good time to launch these campaigns. You are guaranteed to succeed at least 61% of the time. 
    - There were no cancellations in the month of October despite cancellation being consistent all throughout the year, and there was a spike in successful and failed campaigns.   
 - **What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**  
   - It's easier (success rate) to meet your goals if the expectation and challenge is less   
   - As he expectation increases (goals), the challenge becomes tough to meet (high failure)    
 - **What are some limitations of this dataset?**
    -It doesn't show the level of effort required to achieve these goals or launch dates.
    
 - **What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**
    - How much success or failure is experienced regionally. E.g Us v The world or continent.
    - Which campaigns meet their deadline date?
